## 🧠 How It Works

- **PDF Creation**: Converts uploaded images into a multi-page PDF using jsPDF.
- **Merge**: Loads multiple PDFs and merges them with pdf-lib.
- **Rotate**: Rotates every page of the uploaded PDF by 90 degrees.
- **OCR**: Uses Tesseract.js to extract readable text from images.
- **Compression**: Reduces PDF size by re-saving and optionally minimizing font sizes.
